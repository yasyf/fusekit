## Style

**Comments are terse and used sparingly — the code documents itself** through names, types, and organization. The one exception is documentation-generation comments: godoc on exported types, funcs, and the package, each starting with the identifier's name (`// NewRootCmd builds …`); unexported helpers get none. Beyond godoc, comment only for TODOs, non-obvious workarounds, or disabled code — never to restate the signature.

## General Rules

**Minimal changes.** Stay within scope; fix the issue, then stop.

**Match surrounding code.** Follow the conventions of the file you're in, then the module.

**No defensive coding.** No fallbacks, shims, or backwards-compat layers; no guards against impossible states. If unused, delete it. Crash on the unexpected.

**Search before writing.** Before creating a helper, query the codebase via `ccx code search` (intent or symbol queries both work). Sibling modules and base classes win over re-implementation.

**Code stewardship.** When you touch a file, fix nearby bugs, style violations, and broken tests; don't wave them off as pre-existing or out of scope.

**Observe, don't infer.** Inspect actual data — read fixtures, dump objects, run the code — before reasoning from assumption.

**Don't use external failures as an excuse to stop.** API quota, rate-limit, and outage errors rarely block the whole task; trace the catch sites and confirm a failure actually stops you before claiming it does.

**Verify before asserting.** Don't report something as working, fixed, blocked, or impossible until you've checked — run it, read the output, reproduce the failure. "It should work" is not "it works."

**Reproduce before fixing.** When something breaks, isolate the smallest failing case before editing or re-running. Re-running the whole command while changing code between runs hides the root cause; narrow to the one failing call, payload, or test first.

**Research after repeated failure.** After ~2 failed approaches, stop guessing and gather evidence — search the web, read the docs and source — before a third attempt.

**Get a second opinion on a plateau.** On a debugging plateau (2 failed attempts before a 3rd), a non-trivial architectural decision, or algorithmic/security-sensitive code, get an outside check (e.g. `/codex`) before committing to the approach.

**Don't contort code to satisfy a checker.** The type checker and linter serve the code, not the other way around. Don't reshape a data model, widen a type, or bolt on a `cast(...)` / narrowing-only `assert isinstance(...)` / blanket ignore just to silence a diagnostic. If a clean fix isn't obvious, leave the diagnostic — a visible diagnostic is preferable to scar tissue. (Most checker noise isn't worth acting on at all; act only when it flags a real bug.)

**Mechanical linting.** CI and hooks handle formatting and import order; fix only what needs human judgment. When reviewing code, don't flag mechanical lint violations (line length, whitespace, import order, trailing commas).

**Testing.** Tests live beside the code as `*_test.go`. Pure suite (every commit): `go vet ./... && go test -race -count=1 ./...`, plus `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` to prove the root primitives and all of `mountd` stay cgofuse-free. The fuse host's callback/integration tests need cgo + a FUSE provider: `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags fuse ./...` on macOS (`brew install macos-fuse-t/cask/fuse-t`) or Linux (`apt install libfuse3-dev`). Live mount round-trips gate behind `FUSEKIT_LIVE=1` and run on a scratch path only — never `kill -9` a holder over a mount that matters.

**Writing docs.** When writing or revising docs, a README, a tutorial, a how-to, or reference, use the `writing-docs` skill (Diataxis modes, voice rules, and runnable code-sample rules) and run `slop-cop check <file> --lang=markdown` before you finish.
