// Mounted reports whether dir is currently a mountpoint. It reads the kernel's
// cached mount table with Getfsstat(MNT_NOWAIT) and checks dir for membership.
// MNT_NOWAIT returns the in-kernel snapshot without refreshing any filesystem,
// so the call cannot block — unlike an lstat of the mountpoint, which on a
// fuse-t mirror resolves INTO the NFS-backed fs (a GETATTR) and hangs forever
// on a wedged mount. Either Getfsstat call failing reads false, matching the
// old lstat-based predicate's error-as-not-mounted contract.
//
// Membership in the mount table is identical to the dev-id compare it replaces:
// on macOS a dir's device differs from its parent's iff it is a mountpoint, and
// a mountpoint is exactly what the kernel records as an f_mntonname. Only
// f_mntonname is consulted; f_mntfromname (the mount source) is never matched.
//
// Invariant #3 (AGENTS.md): Mounted is a read-only predicate and never
// realpaths, normalizes, stores, or hashes the account dir itself. The single
// EvalSymlinks in mountCandidates resolves only dir's PARENT — never dir — so
// the mount is never touched, and the resolved spelling is used for comparison
// only (the kernel records a $TMPDIR mount under /private/var/..., a spelling a
// byte-exact match would otherwise miss).
