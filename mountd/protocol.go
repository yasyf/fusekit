// Package mountd is the mount-holder subsystem: a tiny detached process that
// hosts fuse-t mounts so daemon restarts never disturb live consumer sessions.
// The daemon and CLI drive it over its own 0600 unix socket using the
// newline-delimited JSON protocol defined here — one request and one response
// per connection, exactly like the daemon socket.
//
// The holder is stateless mechanism: no consumer state — no sqlite, no
// Keychain, no app-specific imports.
// Desired state lives elsewhere; the holder only mounts and unmounts what it
// is told, and reports kernel truth.
//
// The driver side lives here too: RemoteHost drives the holder from any build
// (Setup / Teardown / Sync / Health), and the shared Retire helper — behind
// RemoteHost.Converge (one-shot) and the RetirePolicy adapter for a supervised
// proc.Supervisor — retires a version-skewed holder and remounts everything it
// served, capturing the holder pid at gate time and force-unmounting dead
// carcasses before the remount.
//
// Compatibility policy: proto-1 ops are FROZEN — their names, fields, and
// semantics never change. New capability means a new op or a new optional
// field, never a rename, repurpose, or retype of an existing one. Drivers
// treat ok=false with an "unknown op" error as not-supported, never as holder
// failure. Bidirectional version skew is routine and must keep working: an
// old daemon drives a new holder (brew upgrades swap the opt_bin binary under
// a running daemon), and a new daemon drives an old holder (the holder
// outlives daemon restarts by design).

// ships no deep verdict — the daemon deep-probes through the kernel mount and
